## Description

This activity Unlock the power of code to create an inclusive online space. In this challenge, my refactor isn't just about meeting standards—it's a commitment to accessibility. Every tag, every alt attribute, and every CSS refinement brings us closer to a web that embraces everyone.

## What I have done

Use Meaningful HTML Tags:

1. Choose tags like <header> and <nav> to give structure and meaning to different parts of your webpage.
Logical HTML Structure:

2. Organize your HTML in a way that makes sense even without styling, ensuring a clear and logical content flow.
Describe Images and Icons:

3. Always include descriptive text using the alt attribute for images and icons, making your content accessible to everyone.
Sequential Heading Tags:

3. Maintain the proper order of heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) for better content structure and search engine optimization.
Concise Page Titles:

4. Craft clear and concise titles within the <title> tag, providing users with a quick understanding of your page's content in browser tabs and search results
